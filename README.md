# Newtonian Reflector Persicope

This repository contains the 3D models for my 3D printed Newtonian reflector persicope final project. I have attached a pdf of the final progress report. 

The newtonian reflector design mitigates chromatic abberation, and the variable focus allows this device to be used both as a telescope and a short-range periscope.

Anyone can create this device at home given the 3D files, posterboard, and the materials listed in the progress report.
